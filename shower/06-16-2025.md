when the breathe of the subsystems of my mind speak to eachother well. I believe in the gift that is
the human experience extrapolating itself in the world beyond my mindr. I finally feel like I can think,
which means the mind runs on a clock and we are CPUs so like honestly now that I know this information
gonna do some greatness and save the earth.
