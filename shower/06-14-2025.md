I am a neurotic person who is trying to get in touch with his
neurons to make a connection and come back to the real world slowly.
If I was a numbskull, I'd be trapped in the inner confines of my
mind forever, but it's interesting to the see the void and come back
out into the light again and again, when they talk about fractals
and stuff in nature they are speaking of the biological formations
from the original genome that originated when earth first spawned
life on this planet. Why would a single cell grow and expand in a
way to collect information from the onsets of it's environment to
manipulate and cultivate this information across the vastness of evolution
to make a organism so complex like a human being.
