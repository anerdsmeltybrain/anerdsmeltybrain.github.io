I am living and I gotta say, the only way for me to focus and truly be
the best version of myself is to probably delete my web browser off my computer
and just follow the unix philosophy in my daily life and how I should live
cause my computer is a entertainment system and also my workstation, so I'm gonna
go towards making it less about entertainment and more about working and to do that
I must cut off my connection to the world which is my internet browser, I can do all
my important stuff on the phone and use the terminal for everything else I care about in
life.
